# What is the project:
Created a project that can solve very large and complex mazes using a recursive
algorithm. This program has recursive algorithm that involves branching and backtracking. 
This program also has an ADT (the TextMaze interface). Program reads and writes to a text file. 
The program uses  constants to avoid hard-coding unnamed values in a program
